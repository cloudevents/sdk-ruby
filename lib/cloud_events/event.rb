module CloudEvents
  ##
  # An Event object represents a complete CloudEvent, including both data and
  # context attributes. The following are true of all event objects:
  #
  #  *  Event classes are defined within this module. For example, events
  #     conforming to the CloudEvents 1.0 specification are of type
  #     {CloudEvents::Event::V1}.
  #  *  All event classes include this module itself, so you can use
  #     `is_a? CloudEvents::Event` to test whether an object is an event.
  #  *  All event objects are immutable. Data and attribute values can be
  #     retrieved but not modified. To "modify" an event, make a copy with
  #     the desired changes. Generally, event classes will provide a helper
  #     method for this purpose.
  #  *  All event objects have a `spec_version` method that returns the
  #     version of the CloudEvents spec implemented by that event. (Other
  #     methods may be different, depending on the spec version.)
  #
  # To create an event, you may either:
  #
  #  *  Construct an instance of the event class directly, for example by
  #     calling {CloudEvents::Event::V1.new} and passing a set of attributes.
  #  *  Call {CloudEvents::Event.create} and pass a spec version and a set of
  #     attributes. This will choose the appropriate event class based on the
  #     version.
  #  *  Decode an event from another representation. For example, use
  #     {CloudEvents::JsonFormat} to decode an event from JSON, or use
  #     {CloudEvents::HttpBinding} to decode an event from an HTTP request.
  #
  # See https://github.com/cloudevents/spec for more information about
  # CloudEvents. The documentation for the individual event classes
  # {CloudEvents::Event::V0} and {CloudEvents::Event::V1} also include links to
  # their respective specifications.

      # Create a new cloud event object with the given version. Generally,

      # `spec_version`, the remaining keyword arguments will be passed
      # through to the {CloudEvents::Event::V1} constructor.

      # @param kwargs [keywords] Additional parameters for the event.
