  # An error raised when a protocol binding was asked to decode a CloudEvent
  # from input data, but does not believe that the data was intended to be a
  # CloudEvent. For example, the HttpBinding might raise this exception if
  # given a request that has neither the requisite headers for binary content
  # mode, nor an appropriate content-type for structured content mode.

  # An error raised when a protocol binding was asked to decode a CloudEvent
  # from input data, and the data appears to be a CloudEvent, but was encoded
  # in a format that is not supported. Some protocol bindings can be configured
  # to return a {CloudEvents::Event::Opaque} object instead of raising this
  # error.

  ##
  # An error raised when a protocol binding was asked to decode a CloudEvent
  # from input data, and the data appears to be intended as a CloudEvent, but
  # has unrecoverable format or syntax errors. This error _may_ have a `cause`
  # such as a `JSON::ParserError` with additional information.
